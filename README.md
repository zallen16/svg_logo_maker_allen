# svg_logo_maker_allen

This application was created from scratch and enables a user to create a simple logo as an SVG file. Using node express, Inquirer, and Jest for testing, the logo is quickly created after a series of brief questions answered by the user. After running node, simply input three letters you need displayed for your logo, pick out a color for this text, the type of shape you need, and the color of said shape, and you have your logo immediately created with all of these aforementioned details.
